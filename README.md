**CANDY-SWEEPER**

"In a land filled with candy & treats there are also items in the land that are not so sweet, land on a bomb and you may face defeat!" 

The objective of this game is to find a row or column of 5 candies while avoiding bombs in the same field. You have 3 lives and a life is taken away when you come across a bomb. You interact with 3 bombs and the game is over and you have to start over. You can be very close to completing your goal and if you come across your third bomb the game will still be over. So pick carefully! Good luck!
